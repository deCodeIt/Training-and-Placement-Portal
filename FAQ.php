						<h2 class="text-primary">FAQs.</h2>
						<br>
						<h5><b>Here you would find answers to frequently asked questions</b></h5>
						<br><br>
						<p class="text-justify"><b>How do I apply for a project?</b><br>
						There is a list of currently running projects available on the portal. Go through 
						this list t find the project that fits your area of expertise. Now, for this project, 
						follow the procedure set out by the company to land the project and all the 
						very best.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>How do I pick an intern?</b><br>
						Out of the applications you can check out the clubs and projects that each of 
						them are involved in by going through their resumes also, we have a 
						mentorship program by which your previous employees from our college will 
						help you choose the best out of them.
						<br><br>
						<b>What if a project is a fake one?</b></br>
						We have taken special care such that any company official can only use their 
						company email id in order to post projects. Even, these companies are peer 
						approved. However, if a fake object is encountered by you under the banner of 
						Xyz Company, then, we would request the company to issue severe warning to 
						defaulter and compensation to the victim. Failing to do so would lead to the 
						company being issued a warning and then finally being blacklisted and 
						deregistered. 
						<br><br>
						<b>What if a student gives me false facts?</b><br>
						We have taken great care to ensure that no student commits such a mistake. 
						However, if a student is found to have submitted incorrect personal facts, we 
						take such issues very seriously a warning would be issued and they are 
						supposed to state the cause of negligence. Following this, we would put the 
						student on probation and all their facts would be checked by their mentors 
						and us personally depending on the severity of the facts forged. 
						<br><br>
						<b>What if a company gives me a bad review despite good work?</b><br>
						To this we suggest that you take down facts and proceedings of your entire 
						work with the company. Document everything officially from the day of your 
						joining to the day of your leave taking. Also, take down their behaviour 
						towards you. If it is a truly unsafe environment then you could save many 
						other students. If injustice has truly taken place in terms of review you can use 
						these documents and not have to bother with their review. Otherwise we will 
						brand your complains as telling tales.
						<br><br>
						<b>What if a student gives me poor or plagiarised work?</b><br>
						We, at IIT Ropar have a very strict policy against plagiarism committed in any 
						field of our work. Any authentic complain linking a student of ours to 
						plagiarism of another person’s recognized work will lead to severe 
						repercussions as, suspension, expulsion or similar from the college. Please 
						note, we take such complains very seriously, and very serious action is taken in 
						both cases if plagiarism is truly detected and if you were to make such an 
						accusation frivolously.
						<br><br>
						<b>What if student is incapable of working in the project?</b><br>
						All companies are allowed to test the students they wish to hire as rigorously 
						as possible. However, if you still encounter a problem with the student we 
						suggest that you make your stipend payment based not on the time put in but 
						the output produced. Then, depending on what the student has done till date 
						for your company you may pay him and dismiss him. The student, is allowed to 
						offer his mentorship to the new applicants for your company, so, we 
						encourage you to exercise good care in selection procedure, and avoid such a 
						situation.
						<br><br>
						<b>What if the work assigned to me is not good enough?</b><br>
						We request all students to go through the project outline and work to be 
						expected from it. They can even seek their mentors help and approach 
						employees of the company using social media forums. However, if you still 
						encounter a problem, unfortunately until and unless the company has gone 
						totally against its project outline we can’t do much. Negligence on your part is 
						also a bad idea because you would have spoilt a position a person more 
						suitable for the job could have taken.
						<br><br>
						<b>What if a company poses a hostile environment?</b><br>
						It is your legal right to be granted a safe work environment and it is your duty 
						to ask for it and maintain it. Harassment complaints made by either party are 
						taken very seriously. It is not only the institute policy but the country’s as well 
						to take strict action. Any student or company official caught indulging in 
						misbehaviour will face consequences. Please realise the sanctity of such 
						complains and refrain from throwing around such accusations.
