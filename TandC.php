						<ul>
<li>
The role of the RnDHub is of a facilitator and platform
placement related activities. It does NOT guarantee a job. 
Applying for a company or joining a company is entirely the 
responsibility/decision of the student concerned.
</li>
<li>The placement facility is available to all the students registered 

with the portal through the policy one job to one student at the 

first instance. If a student is offered a job in a slot, he/she will 

be de-registered from the placement process.

</li>
<li> If a student receives more than one job in one slot, he/she has 

to choose one of the jobs within three hours of the declaration 

of the last result in that slot, or at the end of the slot, 

whichever is earlier.

</li>
<li> There is no restriction on applying/appearing in 

interviews until the first job is secured. A student will be 

considered to have secured a job if his/her name appears in the 

selection list or an appointment letter is received in the 

RnDHub. 

</li>
<li> Students must keep their Identity Card with them at the time 

of PPT/Test/Group Discussion/Interviews, and produce the 

same when asked by the visiting team, SPO staff or their 

representatives.

</li>
<li> Once a student has been shortlisted by a company for 

placement process he/she is NOT allowed to contact the 

members of the team visiting the campus for placement 

purpose without prior permission.

</li>
<li> The RnDHub strongly discourages the students to go for off 

campus placements in the companies that already come to 

IITRpr campus as this affects the company-institute relations 

adversely. Students are also requested to forward contacts 

they have, if any, in different companies so that RnDHub may 

formally invite these companies for placements. These 

companies would then have to take an agreement to protect 

your rights at the work place

</li>
<li> If a student is found doctoring his/her resume submitted at 

RnDHub his/her registration with us will be cancelled 

immediately and the case will be forwarded to the Student 

Affairs and Disciplinary action will be taken.

</li>
<li> If a student is found to have hidden the nature of his/her 

enrolled program, his/her registration at RnD will be cancelled 

immediately and the case will be forwarded to the Student 

Affairs and Disciplinary action will be taken.

</li>
<li> Furthermore the students are advised that when they go 

outside to work under a company under the IIT banner, they 

have the integrity of this title to uphold. Any student found 

maligning the IIT name in any manner would face serious 

repercussions.

</li>
<li> It is not the responsibility of the college to guarantee your 

safety while working with a company outside campus.

</li>
<li> In campus work done for the company, damaging the college 

property or personnel will be liable to punishment.

</li>
<li> Students have to give honest reviews for the help of future 

students as you received from those who came before you.

</li>
<li> Master resume will NOT be sent to the company, you need to 

apply with a different resume for every company.

</li>
<li> No bar on the length of master resume, but each and every 

point will need verification.

</li>
<li> The resume with which one applies for a particular company 

must be a subset of the master resume.

</li>
<li> One cannot add/change any point/sub point that is written in 

the master resume while making his/her resume

</li>
<li> One is allowed to delete points/sub points.

</li>
<li> If you need to state your point in a different way for the 

technical and non-technical profile, we suggest you to include it 

again in the master resume itself even if it causes repetition.

</li>
<li> Any change in the master resume MUST be done with the 

permission of RnDHub; writing the same point in a different 

way will be considered as a 'change'.

</li>
<li> Your resume, before being sent to the company, will be verified 

by a software and if found different from the master resume by 

more than 5%, then your application will get withdrawn from 

that company and will also attract penalty on the part of 

student.
